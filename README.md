# UdacityProject1
First project as first part of Data Scientist Nanodegree
The project seeks to use a public data set re Stroke incidence from Kaggle to answer three questions:
1. Does age play a role in stroke incidence?
2. Is hypertension more likely to lead to strokes?
3. Can we predict who is likely to have a stroke based on their characteristics?
